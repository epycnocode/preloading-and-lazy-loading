# Webflow Speed Demon: Preloading & Lazy Loading for a Turbocharged UX

Imagine your Webflow site as a race car, tearing through the internet with blazing speed. That's the power of preloading and lazy loading! These techniques minimize wait times, keeping your visitors engaged and coming back for more. Here's the lowdown with a clean code example:

**1. Preloading:**

Think of it as priming the engine. You tell the browser to pre-load critical resources like fonts and logos beforehand, minimizing the initial lag. It's like giving your visitors a sneak peek, keeping them excited and engaged before the main show starts.

**2. Lazy Loading:**

Imagine a scenic road trip where you only see the upcoming scenery as you approach it. Lazy loading works similarly. It loads non-essential elements like images and videos only when they are scrolled into view. This reduces the initial page weight, making your site feel lighter and faster.

**3. Code Example:**

**Preloading:**

```
HTML
<link rel="preload" as="font" href="/fonts/myfont.woff2" crossorigin>

```

This tells the browser to pre-load the "myfont.woff2" font file before the rest of the page loads.

**Lazy Loading:**

```
HTML
<img src="/placeholder.png" data-src="/images/hero.jpg" loading="lazy">
```

This shows a placeholder image while the actual hero image ("hero.jpg") is lazily loaded when the user scrolls down to see it.

**4. Remember:**

  - Preload only essential resources to avoid overloading the browser.
  - Use lazy loading for non-critical elements like images and videos.
  - Test your implementations thoroughly to ensure smooth performance across devices.

**Bonus Tip:** Explore Webflow's built-in "Lazy Loading Images" setting to easily activate lazy loading for all images on your site.
